#Das¬†Zeugnisblatt APP

#### Basic CRUD App- Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è in Flask By Alvison Hunter Arnuero - September 14th, 2020.

Welcome to the **Das¬†Zeugnisblatt APP**, my first CRUD application made in python and Flask. This readme file will give you an overview of the characteristics I put together when building this app. _This project is still undergoing construction but I hope I have more time in the upcoming days to advance with it and put some missing features that I have planned to add soon._

## Basic Features

- Basic Routing
- 404 error handling
- development env startup
- Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality
- Modern user interface
- Bootstrap 4 CSS framework
- Limited custom css/js
- Easily customizable

Upcoming feature: We will add filters to work with the results table.

## Setup

Make sure to have Python 3.6 or newer, and pip installed.

#### Get virtualenv

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
```

#### Create a virtual environment. You can use any name you want, I usually use "venv" as the below command:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

#### Proceed to activate this environment with the below command.

```bash
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

Now you have activated your virtual environment and your terminal should display its name as so:

```bash
$(venv)
```

#### Now, Clone the repository into your local environment folder

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AlvisonHunterArnuero/zeugnisblatt.git
$ cd zeugnisblatt
```

#### To run this application yourself, please install its requirements first:

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt --ignore-installed
```

#### Run the application with the below command.

```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ flask run
```

#### Optionally you can set FLASK_ENV=development like this:

```bash
$ FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run
```

You‚Äôll see output similar to this on the screen:

```bash
$ FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run

 * Serving Flask app "app.py" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 325-388-378
```

Afterwards, point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or the localhost:5000, then check out the source code with your favorite editor. I use Visual Studio Code and Sublime sometimes. Any feedback in regards this code will certainly come handy, thanks for the support, folks!
