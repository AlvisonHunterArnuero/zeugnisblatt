To run and start this app locally once is installed, we do as follows:

- move to the folder where the app is located.
- get into the env folder on your app, in this case is "venv"
- activate the virtual environment with this command:
source bin/activate

Then, you can actually proceed to run the application.
$ export FLASK_APP=sample_app
$ flask run

Optionally you can set FLASK_ENV=development like this:
$ FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run

Afterwards, point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or the localhost:5000, then check out the source. Enjoy it, folks!

NOTE TO INSTALL A FLASK APP FROM SCRATCH:

First things first, let’s get a working directory set up:

$ mkdir <your-app-name> && cd <your-app-name>
Initialize a new git repo within your working directory:
$ git init

Set up a virtual environment to use for our application:
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate

You should now see you (env) to the left of the prompt in the terminal,
indicating that you are now working in a virtual environment.

In order to leave your virtual environment, just run deactivate, and then
run source env/bin/activate when you are ready to work on your project again.

Next we’re going to get our basic structure for our app set up. Add the following files to your “flask-by-example” folder:
$ touch app.py .gitignore README.md requirements.txt

This will give you the following structure:

├── .gitignore
├── app.py
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt

Be sure to update the .gitignore file from the repo.

Next install Flask:
$ python -m pip install Flask==1.1.1

Add the installed libraries to our requirements.txt file:
$ python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt

Open up app.py in your favorite editor and add the following code:

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
Run the app:

$ python app.py
And you should see your basic “Hello world” app in action on http://localhost:5000/. Kill the server when done.
